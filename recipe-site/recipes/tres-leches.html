<h1>Tres Leches</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
A truly Venezuelan tres leches cake is something that changes your life. I’m not even exaggerating with this. To say that this spongy cake sogged in the most delicious milk cream is “good” is a major understatement.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 eggs </li>
        <li>1 cup self-raising flour</li>
        <li>⅔ granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>

    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180 C (350 F)</li>
        <li>Separate the egg whites from the yolks.</li>
        <li>Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks. Add half of the sugar in small batches during the process.</li>
        <li>Beat the yolks and add the remaining sugar. Beat until the yolks are creamy and lighter.</li>
        <li>With a spatula, mix gently the egg whites with the yolks.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, the vanilla extract, and the salt. Incorporate with encircling movements. Don’t beat the batter or all that air that we previously built will be gone.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into a greased cake pan and take it to the oven for 15 minutes until the cake is slightly brown.</li>
        <li>Let the cake chill completely.</li>
    </ol>
